If you're specifically looking for cloud-based LLMs that can generate Python scripts, here are some of the top options:

### 1. CodeLlama - Python (Meta)

**CodeLlama - Python** is a version of Meta's CodeLlama model that is fine-tuned specifically for Python programming. It is one of the most advanced models for code generation, trained on a massive dataset of code-related data, including 100 billion tokens of Python code. This model excels at generating Python scripts, solving coding problems, and completing code snippets. It also supports tasks like debugging and code explanation, making it highly suitable for developers working with Python\[1]\[3].

### 2. OpenAI Codex (GitHub Copilot)

**OpenAI Codex**, which powers GitHub Copilot, is another powerful LLM designed for code generation, with Python being its strongest language. Codex can generate entire Python functions or scripts based on natural language prompts and provides real-time suggestions within IDEs like Visual Studio Code. It also helps with debugging and syntax correction, making it a versatile tool for Python developers\[3]\[4].

### 3. Google Cloud's Vertex AI (Gemini Code Assist & Codey APIs)

Google Cloud offers **Gemini Code Assist** and **Codey APIs**, which are capable of generating Python scripts from natural language descriptions. These models support multiple programming languages, including Python, and can help with tasks like code completion, function generation, and debugging. The models are integrated into Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform, allowing developers to use them through various interfaces like chatbots or IDE extensions\[2].

### 4. StarCoder (Hugging Face & ServiceNow)

**StarCoder**, developed by Hugging Face as part of the BigCode project, is another excellent LLM for generating Python code. It has been trained on a large dataset of permissively licensed GitHub repositories and can generate Python scripts from natural language prompts. StarCoder also supports features like infilling (inserting code into existing scripts) and large-batch inference\[1]\[3].

### 5. Phind-CodeLlama

**Phind-CodeLlama** is a fine-tuned version of CodeLlama, optimized for generating high-quality Python code. It has achieved strong results in benchmarks like HumanEval, making it a reliable option for developers who need to generate complex Python scripts or solve coding challenges\[1].

### 6. GPT-4 (OpenAI)

While not exclusively designed for coding, **GPT-4** is highly capable of generating Python scripts based on natural language prompts. Its versatility allows it to handle complex tasks such as explaining algorithms or debugging code in addition to script generation\[3]\[4].

This page is part of 'LLMs-on-LLMs,' a Github repository by Daniel Rosehill which explores how curious humans can use LLMs to better their understanding of LLMs and AI. However, the information should not be regarded as authoritative and given the fast pace of evolution in LLM technology will eventually become deprecated.
