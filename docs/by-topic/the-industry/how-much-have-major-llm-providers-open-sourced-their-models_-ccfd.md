Here is an overview of the extent to which **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **Meta**, and **Le Mistral** have open-sourced some or all of their models:

## OpenAI

OpenAI has not open-sourced its models. Its flagship models, such as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, are proprietary and only accessible via API. OpenAI has focused on providing these models as paid services through its platform, offering no public access to the underlying code or model weights. This approach contrasts with the open-source trend, as OpenAI prioritizes control over its models for commercial and safety reasons\[8].

## Anthropic

Anthropic, like OpenAI, has not open-sourced its models. The Claude family of models (including Claude 3.5) is available through APIs on platforms like AWS Bedrock and GCP Vertex AI but remains proprietary. Anthropic emphasizes safety and alignment in AI development, which may contribute to its decision to keep its models closed-source\[2]\[6]. There is no indication that Anthropic plans to release model weights or training data for public use.

## Meta

Meta has embraced open-source AI more fully than OpenAI or Anthropic. Its LLaMA series of large language models (LLaMA 2 and LLaMA 3) are available under various licenses, including open-weight releases for researchers and developers. Meta's LLaMA 3.1, the largest model with 405 billion parameters, is touted as the most powerful open-source model to date, with weights available for customization and fine-tuning\[5]\[9]. However, there has been some criticism regarding whether Meta’s models are truly "open source" because the company does not release training data or algorithms\[11]. Despite this, Meta’s commitment to open-weight models makes it a leader in the open-source AI space.

## Le Mistral

Le Mistral is a strong advocate for open-source AI. The company has released several models with open weights under permissive licenses like Apache 2.0. Notable models include Mistral 7B and Mistral NeMo (12B parameters), both of which are fully open-source and available for modification and fine-tuning\[4]\[7]\[10]. Le Mistral’s emphasis on transparency and decentralized development positions it as one of the most prominent players in the open-source AI movement.

### Summary Table

| Company    | Open-Sourcing Approach                                                             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI     | No open-sourcing; proprietary models accessible via API only\[8].                  |
| Anthropic  | No open-sourcing; proprietary Claude models available via API\[2]\[6].             |
| Meta       | Open-weight LLaMA series (e.g., LLaMA 3.1) but no training data\[5]\[9].           |
| Le Mistral | Fully open-source models with permissive licenses (e.g., Apache 2.0)\[4]\[7]\[10]. |

In conclusion, while OpenAI and Anthropic have opted for closed ecosystems, Meta and Le Mistral have embraced varying degrees of openness, with Le Mistral standing out for its fully open-source approach.

However, the information should not be regarded as authoritative and given the fast pace of evolution in LLM technology will eventually become deprecated.
