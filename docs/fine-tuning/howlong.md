# Prompt

Fascinating. how long do you think the project would take? And once I've fine tuned my model ... can I open source it?

# Output

The timeline and open-sourcing considerations for your project depend on several factors. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. Project Timeline

#### Data Collection and Preparation (1-2 weeks)

- **Automated Data Collection**: If you’re using APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, GDELT), setting up a pipeline to gather the necessary data might take about **1 week**. Manually curating summaries for specific articles could extend this timeline if you're going for a more hands-on approach.
- **Data Cleaning and Formatting**: Processing the data (cleaning noise, formatting for training) will take around **3-5 days**.

#### Fine-Tuning Process (1-2 weeks)

- **Choosing and Setting Up the Model**: Selecting an appropriate model (e.g., T5, GPT-Neo) and environment (e.g., Hugging Face, Colab) typically takes **1-2 days**.
- **Training the Model**:
  - **Small to Medium-sized Models** (like T5-small or GPT-Neo) will take about **1-2 days** on a GPU environment like Google Colab or AWS. Larger models (GPT-2 or GPT-3-scale models) can take much longer if fine-tuned on extensive datasets.
  - **Iterations and Adjustments**: You’ll likely need a few rounds of trial and error, so plan for an extra **1 week** to refine the training parameters and evaluate model performance.

#### Evaluation and Testing (1 week)

- **Testing on New Data**: After fine-tuning, testing the model on unseen geopolitical news articles and evaluating the quality of summaries might take **3-5 days**.

#### Deployment (1 week)

- **API Deployment**: Setting up a deployment solution (e.g., Hugging Face Inference API or a custom API) typically takes **1-2 days**.
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: After initial deployment, you might want to set up continuous fine-tuning and monitoring pipelines, which could take another **few days**.

#### Total Estimated Time

- **4-6 weeks**: Assuming no significant blockers, this timeline is a good estimate for completing the project end-to-end.


### Summary:

- **Timeframe**: Your project could take around **4-6 weeks** to complete depending on the complexity, data availability, and model size.
- **Open-Source Potential**: You can absolutely open-source the fine-tuned model, provided the base model and data are appropriately licensed. Hugging Face Model Hub and GitHub are ideal platforms for sharing.
