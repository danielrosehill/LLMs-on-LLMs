You are looking for tools to run prompt evaluation experiments locally on your OpenSUSE system. Below is a list of tools that can be hosted in a local environment and are suitable for comparing and testing prompts:

## 1. Promptfoo

Promptfoo is a versatile tool designed for testing, evaluating, and benchmarking prompts. It allows you to:

- Run evaluations locally.
- Test prompts with multiple models (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.).
- Automate scoring of outputs based on custom metrics.
- Use it as a CLI or integrate it into CI/CD pipelines.\
  It is entirely open-source and can be run in a local environment, making it ideal for privacy-conscious users like yourself.**Installation**: You can install and run it via npm.

```bash
npx promptfoo@latest init
```

## 2. ChainForge

ChainForge is an open-source visual programming environment that allows you to experiment with and evaluate prompts across different LLMs. It supports querying multiple models simultaneously, comparing prompt variations, and setting up evaluation metrics.

- It can be installed locally using Python's `pip`.
- Offers a browser-based interface (localhost).**Installation**:

```bash
pip install chainforge
chainforge serve
```

Then access it via `localhost:8000` in your browser.\

## 3. PromptTools

PromptTools by Hegel AI is another open-source tool focused on testing and experimenting with prompts locally. It provides integrations with various LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, LLaMA) and vector databases. You can run tests using Jupyter notebooks or a Streamlit-based playground interface.**Installation**:

```bash
pip install prompttools
```

You can also clone the repository and run the playground:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools.git
cd prompttools && streamlit run prompttools/playground/playground.py
```

This page is part of 'LLMs-on-LLMs,' a Github repository by Daniel Rosehill which explores how curious humans can use LLMs to better their understanding of LLMs and AI. However, the information should not be regarded as authoritative and given the fast pace of evolution in LLM technology will eventually become deprecated.
