Here are some prompt templates you can use to generate a comprehensive technical specification document like the one I just provided. These prompts can help you efficiently structure different sections of a **Tech Spec** document by focusing on the key aspects of the project.


### 2. Tech Stack Description Template

*Prompt:*

> "List and describe the technology stack for a project involving \[describe the project]. Include a description of the frontend framework, backend framework, database, search engine, and any other relevant technologies. Explain why each technology is suitable for the project."

*Example:*

> "List and describe the technology stack for a knowledge base that stores LLM outputs and allows users to search and edit them. Include the following: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and ElasticSearch for search capabilities. Explain the advantages of each in this context."


### 4. System Architecture Template

*Prompt:*

> "Provide a high-level system architecture for a project that includes \[describe the components]. The architecture should explain how the frontend communicates with the backend, how data is stored in the database, and how search functionality is integrated. Include details on API communication, data flow, and how each component interacts."

*Example:*

> "Provide a high-level system architecture for a knowledge base that uses React as the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and ElasticSearch for search. Include how the frontend communicates with the backend, and how search queries and data storage work."


### 6. Feature Prioritization and MVP Template

*Prompt:*

> "Create a prioritized list of features for an MVP of a \[describe the system]. Explain which features are essential for the first release, which are medium priority, and which can be added later as enhancements."

*Example:*

> "Create a prioritized list of features for an MVP of a knowledge base system. Prioritize backend CRUD functionality, frontend note creation and editing, and search features for the first release. Consider tagging and versioning as medium priority, and advanced authentication and mobile optimization as low priority."


### 8. Future Enhancements Template

*Prompt:*

> "Provide a list of potential future enhancements for a system that \[describe the current features]. Include features that could improve the user experience, performance, or security. Indicate which enhancements might require significant changes to the system architecture."

*Example:*

> "Provide a list of potential future enhancements for a knowledge base system that stores LLM outputs. Include features like two-factor authentication, advanced analytics, collaborative note editing, and automated summarization of LLM responses. Indicate that collaborative editing may require significant changes to data synchronization."


These templates should help you capture different parts of your project effectively and ensure that anyone reviewing your spec document can clearly understand and execute your project in the future.

*The above text was generated by a large language model (LLM) and its accuracy has not been validated. This page is part of 'LLMs-on-LLMs,' a Github repository by Daniel Rosehill which explores how curious humans can use LLMs to better their understanding of LLMs and AI. However, the information should not be regarded as authoritative and given the fast pace of evolution in LLM technology will eventually become deprecated. This footer was added at 16-Nov-2024.*
