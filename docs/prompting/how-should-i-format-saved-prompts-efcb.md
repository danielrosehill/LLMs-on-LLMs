# Prompt

Here's an example of a prompt that I would like to save in a prompt library. What format makes the most sense? I'm looking for a tool to help me manage my small business. While I use and love Google Workspace, I'm trying to find a business management tool to do everything else. I'm a consultant with one client, but open to doing more business. I don't have inventory. Functionalities that I need: - Invoicing - Expense tracking - Receipts - Client management It would be nice to also get: - Financial analytiycs - Predictive analytics - AI integration - Scalable system - Integrated email (ie with Workspace) Please only include tools that: - Are well established - Are SaaS / don't have to be self hosted - Cost \< $100/month Don't consider: - Zoho - Odoo - Tools that require stacking to get these features - Companies based in India Thing that I don't need - Email marketing

# Output

For organizing your prompt library, a structured format will help you quickly find, modify, and reuse prompts. Here's a suggested format that includes metadata, the prompt itself, and any special instructions or notes for customization:

### Prompt Title:

**Small Business Management Tool Recommendations**

### Category:

Business Tools, SaaS Solutions

### Use Case:

Request for business management software with specific features and requirements for a consultant.

### Core Prompt:

"I'm looking for a tool to help me manage my small business. While I use and love Google Workspace, I'm trying to find a business management tool to do everything else.

I'm a consultant with one client, but open to doing more business. I don't have inventory.

Functionalities that I need:

- Invoicing
- Expense tracking
- Receipts
- Client management

It would be nice to also get:

- Financial analytics
- Predictive analytics
- AI integration
- Scalable system
- Integrated email (i.e., with Workspace)

Please only include tools that:

- Are well-established
- Are SaaS / don't have to be self-hosted
- Cost \< $100/month

Don't consider:

- Zoho
- Odoo
- Tools that require stacking to get these features
- Companies based in India

Things that I don't need:

- Email marketing"

### Special Instructions:

Exclude certain tools (Zoho, Odoo, Indian companies). Focus on SaaS solutions under $100/month.

### Notes:

Can be modified to ask for other business models (e.g., inventory-based, product-based).

This format ensures you capture all relevant information while keeping it easy to search and reuse later.
