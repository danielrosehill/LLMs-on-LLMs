Please describe the aspect ratios and pixels that DALLE can generate at. Please provide prompt snippets explaining how to request specific aspect ratios.

# Output

**DALL-E** can generate images in the following **aspect ratios** and **pixel dimensions**:

1. **Square**:
   - **1024 x 1024 pixels**.
   - This aspect ratio is 1:1, perfect for balanced compositions without favoring width or height.
   - **Prompt Snippet**: *"Create a square image of..."*
2. **Landscape (Wide)**:
   - **1792 x 1024 pixels**.
   - This aspect ratio is 16:9, which is suitable for wide, landscape-oriented images. It works well for scenes that require more horizontal space.
   - **Prompt Snippet**: *"Generate a wide-angle image of..." or "Create a landscape-oriented image of..."*
3. **Portrait (Tall)**:
   - **1024 x 1792 pixels**.
   - This aspect ratio is ideal for vertical, portrait-oriented images, making it useful for subject-focused compositions.
   - **Prompt Snippet**: *"Generate a portrait-oriented image of..." or "Create a tall image of..."*

### Prompt Snippets for Aspect Ratios:

1. **Square (1:1 aspect ratio)**
   - *"Generate a square image of a sloth sitting at a desk."*
2. **Landscape (16:9 aspect ratio)**
   - *"Generate a landscape-oriented photo of a family of sloths building a sukkah."*
   - *"Create a wide-angle image of a bustling marketplace."*
3. **Portrait (9:16 aspect ratio)**
   - *"Generate a portrait-oriented image of a sloth lighting Shabbat candles."*
   - *"Create a tall image of a mountain climber reaching the peak."*

These prompt snippets will help DALL-E understand your desired aspect ratio and orientation to better match your requirements for the generated image.
