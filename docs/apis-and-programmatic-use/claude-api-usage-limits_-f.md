# Prompt

Does anthropic impose usage limits on claude accessed by API? if so is there a comparable LLM without such a limit and API access?

# Output

Yes, **Anthropic imposes usage limits on Claude when accessed via API**. These limits are categorized into two main types:

1. **Spend Limits**: These set a maximum monthly cost that an organization can incur for API usage. The spend limit depends on the usage tier, and once the limit is reached, the organization must wait until the next month to continue using the API unless they qualify for a higher tier by meeting certain deposit and wait period requirements. For example, in Tier 1, the maximum spend is $100 per month, and this increases with higher tiers\[1]\[6].
2. **Rate Limits**: These restrict the number of API requests and tokens that can be used over a specific period (e.g., requests per minute or tokens per day). For instance, Claude 3.5 Sonnet allows up to 50 requests per minute and 40,000 tokens per minute, with a daily token limit of 1,000,000\[1]\[6].

If you're looking for comparable large language models (LLMs) without such stringent limits and with API access, here are some alternatives:

- **Cohere**: Offers LLMs with a free tier for certain models like Command-R. It may have some rate limitations but generally provides flexible access\[2]\[7].
- **Hugging Face**: Provides access to various open-source models like GPT-NeoX-20B and BLOOM through its API. These models are often more customizable and may have more permissive usage policies depending on the hosting provider\[3]\[7].
- **ArliAI**: This service claims to offer a free tier with unlimited generations (no token or request limits), making it an attractive option for personal projects\[4].
- **Eden AI**: Offers access to multiple LLMs through a standardized API, allowing developers to compare pricing and usage across different providers\[7].

Each of these alternatives has its own strengths in terms of flexibility or cost-effectiveness, so you can choose one based on your specific needs.

This page is part of 'LLMs-on-LLMs,' a Github repository by Daniel Rosehill which explores how curious humans can use LLMs to better their understanding of LLMs and AI. However, the information should not be regarded as authoritative and given the fast pace of evolution in LLM technology will eventually become deprecated.
