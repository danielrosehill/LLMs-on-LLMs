# Prompt

Can GPT 4o with web browsing be used programatically / by API

# Output

Yes, GPT-4 with web browsing can be used programmatically via OpenAI's API. However, currently, the GPT-4 models available through the API do not include the browsing feature. Browsing is only available in the ChatGPT product interface (via the web or app) for pro users.

As of now, GPT-4 with web browsing cannot be directly accessed through an API. If your goal is to retrieve real-time data or perform web scraping, you'd need to integrate external tools (such as Python libraries or APIs for web scraping) with GPT-4 API to achieve similar results.

If you have any specific use cases or workarounds in mind, I can guide you on how to combine GPT-4 API with other tools to accomplish those tasks.
