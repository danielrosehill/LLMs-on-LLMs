# Prompt

I'm looking for the following:

a chatbot interface that I can self-host and use to chat with commercial LLMs (OpenAI, Claude for example) through API integrations

I would also require the ability to save conversations to some kind of storage - perhaps a database.

Are there any tools that can do all of this?
