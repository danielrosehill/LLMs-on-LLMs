# Prompt

A user accesses GPT 4o via its API.

What is the rate-limit that will affect the volume of output the API can generate per limit?

As this is expressed in tokens, approximately how many words does this work out to be?

# Output

You asked about the rate limit for GPT-4o when accessed via its API, specifically how the token-based limit affects the volume of output and how this translates into words.

### Rate Limits for GPT-4o API

The rate limits for GPT-4o are typically expressed in terms of *tokens per minute* (TPM) and *requests per minute* (RPM). Based on the default tier for GPT-4o, the following limits apply:

- **Tokens per minute (TPM):** 450,000 tokens
- **Requests per minute (RPM):** 2,700 requests\[1].

This means that within one minute, you can generate up to **450,000 tokens** across all requests.

### Token to Word Conversion

Tokens are not equivalent to words; they represent pieces of words or entire words depending on their length. On average, **1 token ≈ ¾ of a word** in English. This translates to approximately **100 tokens ≈ 75 words**\[4].

To calculate how many words the token limit allows:

- **450,000 tokens ≈ 337,500 words** per minute.

### Maximum Output Per Request

Each individual API request is limited to a maximum of **4,096 tokens** for GPT-4o\[2]\[3]. Using the same token-to-word conversion:

- **4,096 tokens ≈ 3,072 words** per request.

### Summary

- **Rate limit:** Up to 450,000 tokens per minute (default tier).
- **Words per minute:** Approximately 337,500 words.
- **Max output per request:** Approximately 3,072 words.

These limits ensure substantial throughput but also impose constraints on individual responses.
