Based on the laptop specifications shown in the image (ThinkPad E15 Gen 3 with AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM), here are suitable LLM options for local running:

## Recommended Models

**Open Hermes Mistral 7B**

- Requires about 4GB RAM and storage
- Known for good instruction following and performance
- Works well with Q4 quantization for efficiency\[7]

**Ollama-Compatible Models**

- Supports various AMD GPUs
- Can run models like Llama 2, CodeLlama, and Mistral
- Easy to set up and use with simple commands\[4]

## Running Options

**LM Studio**

- User-friendly desktop application
- Supports downloading and running various open-source models
- Works well with AMD Ryzen processors\[6]

**Setup Requirements**

- For optimal performance, use Q4 K M quantization
- Enable GPU offload if using AMD Radeon graphics
- Ensure you have sufficient storage for model files (typically 4-8GB per model)\[6]

## Performance Considerations

For your specific hardware:

- Focus on 7B parameter models, which offer good performance while being resource-efficient
- Avoid larger models (>13B parameters) as they may strain your system
- Use quantized versions (Q4/Q8) to reduce memory requirements\[5]

The laptop's 16GB RAM should be sufficient to run most 7B parameter models comfortably, though you may want to close other memory-intensive applications while using the LLMs\[2].
