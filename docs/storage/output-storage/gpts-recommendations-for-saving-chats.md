To save your ChatGPT conversations on your phone for later access, here are a few effective methods:

1. Screenshot the Conversation: You can take screenshots of your conversation and store them in a dedicated folder on your phone, so you can refer to them later.
2. Copy and Paste to a Notes App: Most phones come with a notes app (like Google Keep, Apple Notes, or OneNote). You can copy the conversation and paste it there. This method allows for easy access and organization.
3. Export to a Cloud Service: You can copy and paste the conversation into a document (Google Docs, Word, etc.) and store it in a cloud service (like Google Drive or Dropbox). This gives you access across multiple devices.
4. Use a Bookmarking System: Some apps offer a bookmarking or "pin" feature that can save individual chats for later retrieval.
5. Email the Conversation to Yourself: You can copy the text and send it to yourself via email for long-term storage and easy searchability.
6. Dedicated Conversation Storage Apps: You could also use a journaling app (like Day One) or document management app to store and organize multiple conversations.

These methods give you flexibility depending on your preference for storage and access.
