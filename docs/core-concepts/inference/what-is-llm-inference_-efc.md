**LLM inference** refers to the process by which a large language model (LLM) generates a response or prediction based on an input prompt, utilizing the knowledge it has learned during its training. Inference is a critical stage in the deployment of LLMs, as it is the step where the model applies its learned patterns to produce meaningful outputs.

### How LLM Inference Works

LLM inference typically involves two key phases:

1. **Prefill Phase**:
   - The input text provided by the user is broken down into smaller units called *tokens* (which represent words or parts of words).
   - These tokens are transformed into numerical representations known as *embeddings*, which the model can process.
   - The model uses these embeddings to understand and analyze the input based on its training data.
2. **Decoding Phase**:
   - The model predicts the next token in a sequence based on the context provided by the input and its prior knowledge.
   - This process repeats iteratively, with each new token being generated one at a time until a complete response is formed.
   - The final output is then converted back into human-readable text.

This process is often described as *auto-regressive*, meaning that each new token generated by the model is fed back into the system as part of the input to predict the next token\[1]\[2]\[3].

### Key Concepts in LLM Inference

- **Probabilistic Nature**: LLMs generate responses based on probabilities. For each possible next word or token, the model calculates the likelihood of that word being correct, selecting the most probable one.
- **Transformer Architecture**: Many LLMs, like GPT models, use a transformer architecture. This structure relies on an *attention mechanism* that helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when predicting each token\[1]\[4].
- **Latency and Throughput**: Two important metrics for evaluating LLM inference performance are:
  - *Latency*: The time it takes for an LLM to generate a response.
  - *Throughput*: The number of tokens or requests processed per second\[2]\[3].

### Optimizing LLM Inference

LLM inference can be computationally expensive due to the large size of these models. Several techniques are used to optimize this process:

- **KV Caching**: This technique stores key and value tensors from previous computations to avoid redundant calculations during token generation, speeding up inference\[3].
- **Model Serving Optimizations**: These include batching multiple requests together and speculative inference, where smaller draft models are used to accelerate response generation\[3]\[4].

In summary, LLM inference is a sophisticated process where a trained language model generates responses by leveraging its learned knowledge. It plays a vital role in enabling real-time applications such as chatbots, language translation, and content generation.

This page is part of 'LLMs-on-LLMs,' a Github repository by Daniel Rosehill which explores how curious humans can use LLMs to better their understanding of LLMs and AI. However, the information should not be regarded as authoritative and given the fast pace of evolution in LLM technology will eventually become deprecated.
