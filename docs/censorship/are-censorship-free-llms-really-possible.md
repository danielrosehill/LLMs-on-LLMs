You asked if a **totally uncensored large language model (LLM)** is possible. The short answer is **yes**, but with significant caveats related to **ethics, safety, and practicality**.

### Theoretical Possibility

Technically, creating a completely uncensored LLM is feasible. Uncensored models are already being developed and used in certain contexts, particularly in open-source communities. For example, models like **Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored** and **Mistral** have been fine-tuned to remove many of the safety filters that prevent them from generating harmful or controversial content\[3]\[9]. These models can be run locally, allowing users to bypass the restrictions imposed by commercial LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

### Challenges and Risks

However, while it is technically possible, there are several challenges and risks associated with totally uncensored LLMs:

1. **Ethical Concerns**: Uncensored models can generate harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, or instructions for illegal activities. This raises significant ethical concerns about their use. For example, users could exploit these models to produce dangerous content like conspiracy theories or violent instructions\[6]\[10].
2. **Safety Issues**: Without safeguards, uncensored LLMs can be misused for malicious purposes. This includes generating disinformation or promoting harmful ideologies. The lack of moderation can make these models particularly dangerous in the wrong hands\[10].
3. **Performance Trade-offs**: Some studies suggest that removing alignment mechanisms (like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, or RLHF) can degrade an LLMâ€™s ability to provide accurate and reliable information. For instance, aligning models with ethical guidelines often improves their ability to handle complex tasks responsibly\[4]\[11]. Uncensored models may outperform aligned ones in certain benchmarks but at the cost of reliability and safety\[9].
4. **Legal and Regulatory Concerns**: Governments and organizations may impose regulations on AI systems to prevent the spread of harmful content. A totally uncensored model could face legal challenges or be banned in certain jurisdictions due to its potential for misuse\[7].

### Current Examples of Uncensored Models

There are several examples of uncensored LLMs available today:

- **Mistral Large 2**: Known for being highly uncensored while maintaining a high level of performance in various tasks\[2].
- **Tiger-Gemma Models**: These are also described as fully uncensored and capable of generating any type of content without refusals\[2].
- **Perplexity's pplx-70b**: This model was intentionally designed to be uncensored, allowing users to explore questions freely without moral judgments or limitations\[6].

### Conclusion

While creating a totally uncensored LLM is technically possible and has already been done in some cases, it comes with significant ethical, safety, and legal risks. The trade-offs between freedom of expression and responsible AI usage make it unlikely that mainstream AI providers will adopt fully uncensored models for public use. Instead, the future may lie in customizable AI experiences where users can choose their own levels of moderation based on their needs and responsibilities.

This page is part of 'LLMs-on-LLMs,' a Github repository by Daniel Rosehill which explores how curious humans can use LLMs to better their understanding of LLMs and AI. However, the information should not be regarded as authoritative and given the fast pace of evolution in LLM technology will eventually become deprecated.  This footer was added at 16-Nov-2024.*
