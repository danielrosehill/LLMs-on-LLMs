# Prompt

This chart shows some LLM APIs. For each, please state whether it can be accessed by a third party chat frontend like Jan (or others).

# Output

The chart you provided lists several LLMs (Large Language Models) along with their costs and usage statistics. Here's an analysis of whether each model can be accessed through third-party chat frontends like Jan or others:

1. **GPT 4o mini**:
   - **Access via third-party frontends**: Yes. GPT-4o mini can be accessed via the OpenAI API, which is supported by many third-party chat frontends such as Jan, LibreChat, and others\[10]\[13].
2. **Cohere R**:
   - **Access via third-party frontends**: Yes. Cohere models, including Cohere R, can be accessed through APIs and integrated into third-party applications like Jan and other platforms that support API-based LLMs\[5]\[11].
3. **Mistral Large**:
   - **Access via third-party frontends**: Yes. Mistral models are accessible via APIs and can be integrated into various platforms, including Jan and other chat interfaces that support API-based models\[4]\[12].
4. **GPT 4o**:
   - **Access via third-party frontends**: Yes. Like GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o is available through the OpenAI API and can be used with third-party chat frontends like Jan\[10]\[13].
5. **Cohere R+**:
   - **Access via third-party frontends**: Yes. Cohere R+ is accessible through the Cohere API and can be integrated into third-party platforms such as Jan or other API-based interfaces\[5]\[11].
6. **Claude 3.5**:
   - **Access via third-party frontends**: Yes. Claude 3.5 can be accessed through the Anthropic API and is supported by several third-party chat interfaces such as Jan, TypingMind, and OpenRouter\[6]\[3].
7. **Claude 3 Opus**:
   - **Access via third-party frontends**: Yes. Claude 3 Opus is accessible via the Anthropic API and can be used with platforms like Jan or other chat frontends that support API integrations\[6]\[3].

In summary, all the listed models can be accessed by third-party chat frontends like Jan, provided you have the necessary API keys for each respective service.
