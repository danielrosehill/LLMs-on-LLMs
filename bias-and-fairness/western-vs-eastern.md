title: "Hypothetical bias evaluation: Western vs. Eastern LLMs"
---

## Prompt

```text
Imagine that we have two LLMs:

- LLM A was trained on training that had an inherently pro-American bias (or an American-centric worldview)  
- LLM B was trained on a totally separate set of training data that had a very different worldview: let's say it's a Chinese LLM

Suggest 5 prompts we could use to evaluate objectively the cultural bias inherent in both of these LLMs.

For each prompt suggest the following:

## Expected results for LLM A

**Evaluating cultural bias in language models (LLMs) requires carefully crafted prompts that elicit responses reflecting the cultural, political, or ideological leanings embedded in their training data. Below are five prompts designed to evaluate the inherent biases of LLM A (pro-American bias) and LLM B (Chinese worldview).**
