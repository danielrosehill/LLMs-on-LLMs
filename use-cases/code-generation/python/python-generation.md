# Prompt

Thank you for producing this excellent list of LLMs that could assist with generating a python gui from natural language. would you mind producing a summary of all the options that you recommended. please compare the top options in a matrix. and order from the best to the least promising for this use case

# Output

Thank you for your appreciation. I'm glad you found the list helpful. Here's a summary of the recommended LLMs for generating Python GUI code from natural language, along with a comparison matrix of the top options.

## Summary

The LLMs and AI tools recommended for generating Python GUI code from natural language can be broadly categorized into:

1. **General-purpose LLMs**: Models like GPT-4, Claude, and PaLM 2, which have strong coding capabilities across multiple languages.
2. **Code-specific LLMs**: Models like OpenAI Codex, Code Llama, and StarCoder, which are specifically trained on code repositories.
3. **Specialized code generation tools**: Tools like GitHub Copilot, Replit's Ghostwriter, and Amazon CodeWhisperer, which are designed for code completion and generation.
4. **Open-source alternatives**: Models like CodeGen, PolyCoder, and InCoder, which offer free and customizable options.

## Comparison Matrix

Here's a comparison matrix of the top options, ordered from the most promising to the least for Python GUI code generation:

| Model/Tool           | Specialization             | Python GUI Support | Availability                    | Integration             |

This page is part of 'LLMs-on-LLMs,' a Github repository by Daniel Rosehill which explores how curious humans can use LLMs to better their understanding of LLMs and AI. However, the information should not be regarded as authoritative and given the fast pace of evolution in LLM technology will eventually become deprecated.  This footer was added at 16-Nov-2024.*
