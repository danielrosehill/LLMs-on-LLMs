**How does WizardCoder compare to GPT-4o for Python coding tasks?**

WizardCoder, particularly the **WizardCoder-Python-34B** model, has gained significant attention in the coding community due to its strong performance in code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval. It has been shown to outperform several models, including older versions of GPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5, and Claude2, with a **pass@1 score of 73.2%** on the HumanEval benchmark\[1]\[2]. In contrast, GPT-4o (a variant of GPT-4 optimized for speed) has received mixed reviews for coding tasks, with users reporting issues such as incorrect code generation and excessive verbosity\[5].
