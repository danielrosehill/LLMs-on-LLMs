# Prompt

> LLMs commonly limit access to their web UIs and usually stratify the limit by access tier. In ChatGPT, paid users have a higher limit than free ones, but if they exceed a certain amount of usage their access is temporarily degraded by limiting access to less favorable models. What is this mechanism called: "rate limiting", "usage limits", or something else?

# Output

The mechanism you are referring to in ChatGPT, where paid users may experience temporary degradation in access to more advanced models after exceeding a certain usage threshold, is typically referred to as **"usage limits"** or **"quota limits."**

While **rate limiting** is a related concept, it specifically refers to controlling the rate of requests over a period of time (e.g., limiting the number of API calls per minute)\[2]\[3]. In contrast, **usage limits** or **quotas** are broader and can include restrictions based on total usage over a longer period (e.g., daily or monthly token limits) or based on different access tiers (free vs. paid users)\[4]\[5].

In this case, when paid users exceed their quota, they may still have access but with reduced functionality, such as being limited to less advanced models like GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4. This is distinct from rate limiting, which would block or slow down requests based on real-time traffic.
