# Prompt

I'm writing up the results of prompting experiments on Github. these involve assessing the capabilities of LLms for various use-cases. Please suggest a format for the actual reports specifying which headings to use and what content to include in each section

# Output

To effectively document your prompting experiments on GitHub, especially when assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for various use cases, you can follow a structured format that clearly communicates the goals, methods, and results of your experiments. Below is a suggested format with appropriate headings and content for each section.

## 1. Introduction

- **Purpose**: Briefly describe the main objectives of your experiments. What are you trying to assess about the LLMs? Why are these use cases important?
- **Context**: Provide background information on the models being tested and their relevance to your project.
- **Scope**: Outline the specific use cases or tasks you are focusing on (e.g., text summarization, code generation, question answering).
- **Summary of Results**: Offer a high-level summary of the key findings or insights from your experiments.

## 2. Experimental Setup

### 2.1 Models and Tools

- List the LLMs being tested (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5) and any relevant configurations (e.g., model versions, API parameters).
- Mention any tools or libraries used for evaluation (e.g., `promptfoo`, `write-the`, MLflow).

### 2.2 Prompts and Use Cases

- Define the prompts or instructions given to the models.
- Describe the specific use cases or tasks you are testing (e.g., generating creative text, answering factual questions).

### 2.3 Test Cases

- Provide details on how you designed test cases. Include both successful and failure scenarios to ensure comprehensive evaluation.

### 2.4 Evaluation Criteria

- Explain how you will measure success or failure for each use case (e.g., accuracy, fluency, creativity).
- Mention any metrics or benchmarks used in your evaluation (e.g., BLEU score, human evaluation).

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Quantitative Results

- Present quantitative data from your experiments using tables, charts, or graphs to compare model performance across tasks.

### 3.2 Qualitative Analysis

- Provide examples of model outputs for different prompts and discuss their quality.
- Highlight interesting or unexpected findings in the model's behavior.

### 3.3 Error Analysis

- Discuss any common errors or limitations observed in the LLM outputs.
- Provide explanations for why certain prompts may have failed or produced suboptimal results.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Performance Comparison

- Compare how different models performed across various tasks.
- Discuss any trade-offs between different models or configurations (e.g., speed vs accuracy).

### 4.2 Insights and Learnings

- Summarize key insights gained from the experiments regarding model capabilities and limitations.

### 4.3 Implications for Future Work

- Discuss how these findings might impact future development or research on LLMs for similar use cases.

## 5. Related Work

- Briefly mention other research or projects that have explored similar use cases with LLMs.
- Compare your approach and findings with related work to highlight what is novel about your experiments.

## 6. Conclusion

- Summarize the most important takeaways from your experiments.
- Reflect on how these results could be applied in real-world applications or future research.

## 7. Future Work

- Suggest potential improvements to your experimental setup (e.g., adding more diverse test cases).
- Propose additional use cases or models that could be explored in future experiments.

## 8. Appendix (Optional)

### 8.1 Detailed Prompts

- Include a list of all prompts used in your experiments for reproducibility.

### 8.2 Raw Data and Outputs

- Provide links to raw data files, logs, or model outputs stored in the GitHub repository.
