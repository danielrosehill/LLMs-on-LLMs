# Prompt

Here's a prompt:

"Provide an overview of the development of OpenSUSE Linux, its evolution over the past few years, and source usage data comparing it with Fedora and other Linux distros. Conclude this report by presenting a summary table"

Create a ranking of 10 LLMs, rating them from "best" to "worst" in your prediction of their ability to deliver a useful output for this prompt. For each, state your reasoning for their position in the "table."

# Output (GPT 4o)

**Ranking of 10 LLMs based on their ability to deliver a useful output for the prompt:**

The prompt asks for an overview of the development and evolution of openSUSE Linux over the past few years, along with a comparison to Fedora and other Linux distributions, culminating in a summary table with usage data. This requires strong capabilities in technical research, summarization, data comparison, and generating structured outputs like tables. Here’s a ranking of 10 LLMs from "best" to "worst" in their predicted ability to handle this task:

| Rank | LLM Name               | Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **GPT-4**              | GPT-4 excels in technical writing, research synthesis, and structuring outputs like tables. It can handle complex queries involving historical context (openSUSE’s evolution), technical comparisons (Fedora vs. openSUSE), and data presentation (usage statistics). |
| 2    | **Claude 2**           | Claude is known for its ability to handle long-form content and technical topics. While not as precise as GPT-4, it can still generate detailed comparisons and structured responses but may need more refinement in presenting nuanced data.                         |
| 3    | **GPT-3.5**            | GPT-3.5 is highly capable of synthesizing information and creating structured outputs like tables. However, it may struggle slightly with the depth of technical detail compared to GPT-4.                                                                            |
| 4    | **LLaMA 2**            | LLaMA 2 has strong general-purpose capabilities and can handle technical content well but may require more guidance or follow-ups to ensure accuracy in comparisons and data-driven insights.                                                                         |
| 5    | **Bard**               | Bard is improving in handling technical topics but may lack precision in complex comparisons between Linux distributions like openSUSE and Fedora. It can generate a decent overview but might miss some finer details.                                               |
| 6    | **Mistral**            | Mistral is good at handling structured tasks but may fall short on the depth required for comparing multiple Linux distributions and their historical evolution. It would likely generate a decent summary but lack comprehensive insights.                           |
| 7    | **Cohere Command R**   | Cohere is strong in generating coherent text but tends to struggle with deeply technical content or tasks requiring detailed comparisons across multiple systems like Linux distributions.                                                                            |
| 8    | **Anthropic Claude 1** | While capable of generating coherent text, Claude 1 struggles with the depth of analysis required for this task, especially when comparing multiple systems or presenting detailed usage data.                                                                        |
| 9    | **OPT (Meta)**         | OPT is less capable when it comes to handling complex technical queries or generating structured outputs like tables. It may provide a basic overview but would likely miss key details in comparison and data analysis.                                              |
| 10   | **BLOOM**              | BLOOM can handle basic text generation but lacks the sophistication needed for detailed technical comparisons or structured output like tables. It would struggle with the specific requirements of this prompt.                                                      |
