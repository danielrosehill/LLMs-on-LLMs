**Summary of Prompt**: Daniel asked whether outputs from GPT are formatted in Markdown when accessed programmatically via the API, similar to the web UI.

Yes, when you interact with GPT models via the API, the outputs can include **Markdown-formatted** text, just like the web UI. The models can generate lists, code blocks, tables, and other markdown elements. The key difference is that, unlike the web UI, the API doesn't automatically render the Markdown—it's returned as plain text with Markdown syntax.

If you want the Markdown to be displayed properly (e.g., code blocks formatted correctly or links rendered), you need to ensure that your interface (like a web app) processes and renders the Markdown appropriately. For web interfaces, this typically involves using a Markdown parser or renderer (e.g., `marked` in JavaScript or `markdown-it`).

In short, the Markdown formatting is there, but you’ll need to handle the rendering yourself when using the API.
