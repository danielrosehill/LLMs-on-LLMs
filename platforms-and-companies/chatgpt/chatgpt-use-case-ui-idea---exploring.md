# Prompt

I have an idea for an app that I'd like to test out. The functionality would be like this. The app uses the OpenAI API (it would ask the user for their key). It only does one thing: come up with an infinite number of suggestions for how ChatGPT could be used. In other words, it suggests use-cases at random. But the use-case suggestions should not repeat. They should be reasonably unique. The interface is a bit like the dating app Tinder. The user can simply indicate that they like the idea or not with a thumbs up thumbs down. The ideas that they like are recorded and saved into a running markdown document on a storage of their choice. Google Drive makes the most sense to me. Could this be built? What do you think of the idea? I think a web UI makes the most sense so that it could be used from a variety of devices.

# Output

Your idea sounds fantastic! Here's a breakdown of the core functionalities and technical implementation:

### App Functionality:

1. **OpenAI API Integration**:
   - The app will use the OpenAI API to generate unique and random use-case suggestions for ChatGPT. The app will ask the user to enter their API key when first setting it up.
   - The suggestions need to be unique, meaning that the app should store previous suggestions to avoid repetition.
2. **Tinder-like UI**:
   - Each suggestion is presented one at a time, with the user given the option to give it a thumbs-up (save it) or thumbs-down (discard it).
   - A card-swiping interface could be used, similar to Tinder, where swiping or tapping thumbs up/down actions the decision.
3. **Save Liked Ideas**:
   - When the user gives a thumbs-up, the idea is recorded and saved into a markdown document.
   - The user can choose a storage solution—like Google Drive, OneDrive, or local storage—where the markdown document will be saved and continuously appended with new liked ideas.
4. **Web UI**:
   - A web interface makes the app device-agnostic, allowing users to access it from their computers, tablets, or phones.
   - **Google Drive integration** will allow the app to directly append to a markdown document saved on the user’s drive. You can implement OAuth2 to securely connect users' Google accounts to the app.


### Development Tools:

- **Front-end**: React.js, Vue.js, or similar for the Tinder-like UI (swiping, thumbs-up/thumbs-down).
- **Back-end**: Node.js (Express), or you could even go serverless with platforms like **AWS Lambda** or **Firebase Functions**.
- **Google API**: For Drive integration, you’ll use Google’s OAuth2 authentication and the Drive API for file handling.
- **Database**: Simple databases like **SQLite**, **Firebase**, or a NoSQL option like **MongoDB** for storing previously generated use cases.


### Next Steps:

- **Prototype the UI**: Design a minimal UI to simulate the swiping/thumbs-up experience.
- **Build the OpenAI interaction**: Write the backend to pull random suggestions from the API.
- **Integrate with Google Drive**: Set up OAuth2 and connect to users' Drive to save suggestions.
