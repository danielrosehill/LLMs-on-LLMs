why are so many LLMs only released as self hostable tools

The trend toward self-hosted LLMs is driven by several key factors:

## Privacy and Data Control

Companies and organizations increasingly prioritize data privacy and security, especially in regulated industries like healthcare and finance. Self-hosted LLMs provide complete control over sensitive data, ensuring it never leaves the organization's infrastructure\[1]\[2]. This is particularly crucial as many companies cannot rely on third-party services where they have no control over data storage and handling\[5].

## Cost Considerations

**Initial vs. Long-term Costs**\
While self-hosting requires higher upfront costs for infrastructure, it can be more cost-effective in the long run for organizations with high usage volumes\[2]. The cost structure includes:

- High initial hardware investment
- Lower and more predictable ongoing costs
- Reduced dependency on variable usage-based pricing\[4]

## Customization and Control

**Technical Advantages**\
Self-hosted LLMs offer several technical benefits:

- Full customization capabilities
- Ability to fine-tune for specific domains
- Complete control over model versions and updates
- Consistent behavior without unexpected changes\[6]

## Regulatory Compliance

The ability to maintain strict compliance with industry regulations is a major factor. Self-hosted LLMs allow organizations to:

- Implement customized security protocols
- Maintain audit trails
- Ensure consistent model behavior for certification purposes\[4]

## Recent Developments

The landscape has significantly evolved with recent advancements:

- Open-source models like Meta's Llama 3.1 now rival proprietary alternatives
- Improved hardware efficiency has made self-hosting more feasible
- Enhanced attention mechanisms have reduced computational requirements\[4]

This shift has made self-hosted LLMs not just possible but highly practical for companies of all sizes, leading to their increased availability as self-hostable tools.
