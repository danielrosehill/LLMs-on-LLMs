# Prompt

Could you suggest some online tools for calculating tokenisation for various popular LLMs (and which have reliable data)?

# Output

Here are some reliable online tools for calculating tokenization across various popular large language models (LLMs):

1. **Unstract Token Calculator**\
   This tool allows you to calculate and compare token counts and costs for several popular LLMs, including OpenAI's GPT series, LLaMA, Claude, Gemini, and others. It is particularly useful for managing tokens in workflows that involve complex document extraction\[1].
2. **LLM Token Counter (token-counter.app)**\
   This browser-based tool supports token counting for a wide range of models, including GPT-4, Claude-3, and LLaMA-3. It performs tokenization directly in the browser using Hugging Face's Transformers.js library, ensuring fast and secure calculations without sending any data to external servers\[4].
3. **LLM Token Counter (llmtokencounter.com)**\
   A simple and efficient tool where users can paste text to calculate the exact token count for models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. It helps optimize usage by providing precise token counts for prompts\[7].

These tools are widely regarded for their ease of use and accuracy in handling tokenization across different LLMs. They also ensure data privacy and security by performing calculations client-side when applicable.

This page is part of 'LLMs-on-LLMs,' a Github repository by Daniel Rosehill which explores how curious humans can use LLMs to better their understanding of LLMs and AI. However, the information should not be regarded as authoritative and given the fast pace of evolution in LLM technology will eventually become deprecated. This footer was added at 16-Nov-2024.*
