As of my last update in October 2023, OpenAI's GPT-4 model comes in different versions, and "turbo" variants are typically optimized for performance and cost-effectiveness. Here's a general breakdown of the differences between a "turbo" version and a standard version of GPT-4, though specifics can vary and should be confirmed with the latest OpenAI documentation:

### Differences between GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo:

1. **Performance**:
   - **GPT-4 Turbo**: Designed to be faster in response times compared to the standard version. The "turbo" designation indicates a focus on speed, making it more suitable for applications requiring quick processing.
   - **GPT-4**: While still performant, the non-turbo version may not be as optimized for speed as the turbo variant.
2. **Cost**:
   - **GPT-4 Turbo**: Generally offered at a lower cost per token or per request compared to the standard version, making it more economical for high-volume usage.
   - **GPT-4**: Typically priced higher than the turbo version, reflecting potentially more intensive computational resources or different architecture.
3. **Use Cases**:
   - **GPT-4 Turbo**: Ideal for applications where speed and cost-efficiency are critical, such as in real-time chatbots or dynamic content generation.
   - **GPT-4**: Might be preferred in scenarios where the highest fidelity of results is crucial, and where slightly longer processing times are acceptable.
4. **Architecture**:
   - The underlying architectural differences are generally not disclosed in detail, but the turbo variant may employ optimizations that reduce computational load or improve throughput.

These differences reflect OpenAI's efforts to provide diverse options to meet various developer needs, balancing performance, cost, and application requirements. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, consulting OpenAI's official resources or announcements is recommended.

However, the information should not be regarded as authoritative and given the fast pace of evolution in LLM technology will eventually become deprecated. This footer was added at 16-Nov-2024.*
